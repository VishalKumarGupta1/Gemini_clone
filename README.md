# Gemini_clone
Built a Gemini Clone app with React.js, integrating the Gemini API to fetch dynamic data based on user queries. Added a feature to display the 5 most recent searches for easy access. Optimized API calls, used React hooks for state management, and ensured a responsive design, with Git for version control.
